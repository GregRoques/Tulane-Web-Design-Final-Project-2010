          <div class="entry">
            <p>Rule of thumb: book your tickets in advance! Not only will this allow you to secure a cheaper price, but it will also give you time to plan your trip and secure your passport - a process which can take up to three months. I recommend booking your flight as early as five months in advance (we booked our flight in June for an October 1st departure).</p>
            <p>A round way coach ticket cost just under $1,100 in 2008. Keep in mind the flight to Russia is nearly 13 hours; if you can spring for first class (and your 6'4&quot; like me), go first class!</p>
            <p>Flight rates for Russia have remained about the same over the past year and a half. Your plane ticket should account for 2/3 of your overall travel expense.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>A Russian passport takes a minimum three months to get back to you once you mail it in. Apply for a passport as soon as you book your tickets to assure it arrives in time for your flight. </p>
            <p>Your passport will run you about $300.</p>
            <p>In addition to a passport, you also need an official invite from the government, or the owner of the residence you will be staying with during your visit, to be allowed into the country. A government invite costs roughly the same as your passport. See the segment <a href="#hostel">Stick to Hostels</a> below  for a tip on how to get a free invite.</p>

            <p>How much money do you have available to spend on your Russian excursion? Take the months leading up to your trip to research where you want to visit and what you want to do.  Read travel guides, websites (like this one!), and blogs. </p>
<p>Your best bet is to over budget just in case you come across a unique opportunity you did not plan for, or see a must have souvenir.</p>
            <p>The Ruble is Russia's standard of currency. This <a href="http://coinmill.com/RUB_USD.html" target="_blank">currency converter</a> should give you an idea of about how much you will get for each dollar.<br />

            <h2>• A Note on the Language Barrier
              </h2>
            <p>Despite U.S. and Russian differences in the past, you will find our cultures actually share quite a bit in common. One of those things, unfortunately, is we tend not to be multi-lingual societies. Aside from Alex - the manager of NOVA Hostels, who I'll introduce to you in the <a href="#hostel">Stick to Hostels</a> section of this page - no one spoke English. I'll elaborate more on the difficulties of this experience in the <a href="dining.html">dining</a> section. </p>
<p>I found this to be a unique and humbling experience (I enjoy a challenge!). What this does mean though, is that you should map out your days beforehand. If you buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Moscow-Mara-Vorhees/dp/1864503599/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272424541&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lonely Planet Moscow</a> guide book (recommended), you get a fold-out map of the city. The map includes a guide to metro stops; use this to plan out your days in advance.</p>
            <p>Its advantageous to know where you are going ahead of time when entering the underground moshpit that is Moscow's metro system. Reaching a pick-up point in the metro is like fighting your way through a packed room of panicked people plowing their way to a fire exit - if my analogy fails to illustrate the strength of the crowds, it is estimated 10 million people travel by metro each day). Stop to figure out where you're going down there and you're likely to be run over.</p>

            <p>	Don’t let <img src= "http://www.impawards.com/2006/posters/hostel_ver5.jpg" width="135" height="168"/>Eli Roth’s 2005 gorefest frighten you; hostels are the way to go for the fiscally conscious traveler. Host of the world’s largest Millionaire’s Fair, its no surprise Russia’s hotels cater to the ultra-wealthy: even a Best Western will run you around $500 a night.<br />
            </p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>

            </p>
            <p>Consider this: Your trip to Moscow may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience; how much time do you plan on spending lounging around your hotel? Thought so! Your oversees lodging need be nothing more than a place for you to store your luggage and get a few hours sleep when you are not out enjoying this culturally rich and exciting new city. Bypass all the bells and whistles (and free HBO) and focus on three factors: price, location and safety.</p>
            <p>I recommend <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/russia/moscow/24387/" target="_blank">Nova Hostel</a>. A five-minute walk from the Red Square, the gorgeous Moscow River, and a multitude of tourist and dining attractions, it's a steal for $55 a night.</p>
            <p><br />
              <img src="additional pics/outside.jpg" width="211" height="158" alt="outside" />The hostel’s exterior is off-putting – to say the least – and had me wondering if I was indeed walking onto a horror film set. My initial hesitation vanished when I walked into our suite: two spacious bedrooms, a commodious living area and a full-kitchen stocked with pastries, seasonings, and a selection of teas and coffees. <img src="additional pics/inside.jpg" width="212" height="158" alt="Inside" />Each room also came with satellite radio and television, and exercise machines.<br />
              Alex, the manager, is very friendly and accommodating, and stocks your kitchen with snacks and fresh coffee grinds every morning. He’s also an encyclopedia of local knowledge, and happily invites hostel visitors out for an evening of dining, drinking and local music with his friends.</p>
<p> •	<span id="df">A Note About Passports</span> (and how Nova can save you $300)</p>
            <p>Show up at customs with only a passport and you’ll spend your 10 days in Russia sleeping at the airport. First time visitors must possess a government issued invitation to enter the country, in addition to a passport.<br />
            </p>
            <p>Government invitations cost around $300, and take up to three months to arrive by mail. There is a way around this: a Russian citizen can send you an invitation for free. Visitors who don’t have a contact in Russia may request an invite from their hotel. However, most hotels will charge you about the same rate. <br />
              Alex sent us invites free of charge and mailed them in a fraction of the time – another reason to stay at Nova Hostel. </p>

            <h2 class="title"><a name="packing">Packing</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Carrying luggage around can be a hassle, especially if you are going to and from the airport using the metro (remember, if you don't speak Russian, its hard to catch a cab ride - the metro may be your only bet). Limit your luggage to just one-suit case.</p>
            <p>Be sure  to research seasonal weather patterns for your trip. Russia can be very cold and damp. If you travel during the winter, be sure to bring thermal weather garments and an umbrella.</p>
            <p>I recommend packing light and doing laundry at the hostel (Nova provides washers/dryers free of charge . . . you can't beat that place!). </p>
            <p>You may want to do laundry at some point anyhow - from the minute you get off the plane to the minute you reboard for your flight home, there are no non-smoking areas in Russia. This is the largest cultural difference I noticed. Restaurants, grocery stores, gyms, you name it - you can light up! More than 50 percent of Russia's population smokes - I have a feeling Moscow's census raises the average quite a bit. If you're a smoker, live it up; the rest of us, well . . . we'll have to live with it.</p>
