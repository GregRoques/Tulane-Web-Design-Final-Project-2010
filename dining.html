            <p>The language barrier really sticks it to you when it comes to dining. How can you order off a menu you can't read?           </p>
            <p>This is where you need to get creative, identifying restaurants where you will be able to order. Below, is a picture of our first Russian diner: American fast-food at the food court in Red Square's famous Gym (prounounced Gum) mall. (Fun fact: Kentucky Fried Chicken is everywhere over there).</p>
            <p><img src="images/soporo.JPG" alt="" width="216" height="162" /></p>
            <p>We tried to limit our food expenditures to $25 a day. </p>
            <p>Here are a few inexpensive places non-Russian speakers will be able to order and keep with t0 budget.</p>

          <h2 class="title"><a name="sushi">Sushi Time</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p><img src="images/PA030173.JPG" width="224" height="167" alt="sushi" />Sushi hit it big in Moscow about 10 years ago. Most Russians don't know what the Japanese names on the menu are, so every option is accompanied by a picture. When the waitress comes around, we  pointed at the dish we wanted.</p>
            <p>I usually ordered a coke to drink. Soft drinks are all served hot in Russia; it's unusual at first, but I didn't find it  unpleasant. In fact, when I returned home and drank a cold Coke, I actually missed the sensation of the room temperature cola. </p>
        </div></div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title"><a name="moomoo">My My</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Pronounced &quot;Moo Moo&quot; - like the sound a cow makes - its Picadilly with traditional Russian food. Again, we found a way to cirumvent the lanuage barrier by going to a buffet.</p>
            <p>Beets, a traditional Russian salad prepared with cabbage, carrots and wild berries is delicious, as is the indiginous wild-berry beverage. The restaurant's logo is a cow with large dough-eyes - imagine a bovine Hello Kitty - chosen because Russian children love them. This is amusing, in a twisted sort of way, as every thing on the menu includes beef. Even some of the deserts have meat in them. Imagine if Disney World featured a chain of restaurants that served mouse on the menu . . . gross, I know, but you get the idea.</p>
            <p>Joking aside, the buffet-style diner allows you to sample an array of traditional Russian dishes for cheap, and nearly everything  is delicious. </p>

          <h2 class="title"><a name="pel">Pelmeshka</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>A restaurant chain with a location just outside the hostel, Pelmeskha received repeat business for being the only restaurant with an English menu. </p>
            <p>A Pelmeshka is essentially a Russian crepe. Inexpensive, tasty, and suitable for any meal of the day. Their Coffee Americano packs the punch of a quadruple espresso.</p>

          <h2 class="title"><a name="pav">Pavillion</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>The &quot;It&quot; restaurant in 2009: a chic,  moderately priced diner popular for serving Russian Fushion. I'm always intrigued by fusion restaurants, particularly since most cultures mold foreign cuisine to conform to their own dining preferences anyway (did you know the burrito was invented in New Mexico? The egg roll in California?). Nonetheless, we gave it a try, and were not disappointed. The salmon I had was glazed in what tasted like a honey/horse radish sauce (I don't recall the name, but it was served at Pelmeshka as well). It was outstanding.

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Moscow's equivalent of Starbucks. A social atmosphere with large, cushioned chairs you can sink into, taking a moment to rest and refuel after spending all day on your feet. Russians like their coffee dark and strong - real strong. Just how I like it. Jason doesn't drink coffee. . . the only thing he drank in Russia that he enjoyed was the MGD.</p>

            <p>Nova Hostel graciously provides you with a complete kitchen. If you want to keep it cheap, see if the travelers sharing the suite with you want to cook one night. A good way to make some new friends and try something new.          </p>
