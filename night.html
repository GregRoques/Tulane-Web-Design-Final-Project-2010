          <div class="entry">
            <p>Russia is know for its wild party scene. If you want to get as much out of your nights as your days, I recommend scheduling your days so you can be back at the hostel for around 6 p.m. Take a 2 -3 hour nap, wake up, take a shower, grab a bite to eat, and go out around 11.</p>
<p>There are countless bars in Moscow, and we visited far to many to recount on this website. Here are our top three pics:</p>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title"><a name="karma">Karma Bar</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p><img src="images/Jazz Band.JPG" width="180" height="136" alt="jazz metal band" />A chic club that is half hookah-lounge, half dance floor. Avant garde artwork and black and white photos add to the decor. Known to be a despot bar, it is the only bar we visited that played popular western music.</p>
            <p>This bar is pricey - splurge here your last night out, or pre-game at one of the many small bars nearby. Chinese Pilot down the road sells cheap bear and features a regular jazz line-up. Karma Bar is also a known for hosting jazz musicians (pictured above).</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Jazz music is popular in Moscow; however, the jazz I heard was much different than the jazz heard drifting through the streets of my hometown, New Orleans. Russian jazz has a heavy industrial-music influence, spiked with brooding, distorted guitars, atmospheric keyboards and  heavy use of symbols. The sound has more in common with a band like Nine Inch Nails  than anything on Bourbon St.<br />

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title"><a name="duck">The Hungry Duck</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p><img src="additional pics/the duck.jpg" width="159" height="150" alt="Hungry Duck" />The legendary wildest bar in Europe. In the interest of keeping this discussion suitable for all ages - and not tarnishing my magnanimous character - my review of the Duck is heavily abridged.</p>
            <p>The Hungry Duck's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Duck" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> provides a suitable foundation for its boastful reputation. The page claims the Duck is tamer then it used to be - an assessment that honestly frightens me more than it intrigues.</p>
            <p>You can also visit their tasteful (sarcasm) and family-values conscious (not recommended viewing for anyone under 18) <a href="http://www.hungryduck.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
            <p>There was a cover charge, which if I remember was inexpensive. The Duck only serves beer: a domestic brand and Miller Genuine Draft (popular in Russia . . . strange, for a country with such expensive taste).</p>

          </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title"><a name="prop">Propaganda</a></h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Fun dance club with cheap prices. If you like club music with a taste of reggae dubbed in, you'll have a good time here.</p>
            <p>Come early for dinner, or visit for lunch if you are in the neighborhood. The food is delicious, and under almost everything is under 10 dollars.</p>
            <p>It's hard to order at the bar from a menu you can't read, so unless you know a little Russian you are pretty much limited to Miller Genuine Draft (ugh!) or rum and coke (phonetically spoken the same in Russian). </p>
            <p>A popular cocktail at the time we were there was a drink called Burn, a mixture of Red Bull and Absinthe. Inexpensive and delicious (if you like licorish).</p>
            <p>Be prepared to get treated well at the bar . . . it is known that Americans tip higher then Russians (who tip 10 percent max, if at all).</p>

            <img src="images/PA060420.JPG" width="196" height="146" alt="raining rubles" display="inline-block;" />
            <p>Located in the Zamoskvorechie district, this exclusive nightclub is rumored to request a copy of your last pay check at the door: your payment must be at least six-figures to enter.</p>
